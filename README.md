# **Cook-N-Brew**: _A Recipe & Brewery finder all-in-one!_

## **Description**  
-------------
This application was built with the idea of wanting to prepare a home-cooked meal and finding/discovering new breweries in your area to pair your meal with!

 A user is able to select a recipe from different categories and view the recipe they want to prepare. Then search for a brewery in their area to enjoy after dinner or to grab-and-go from for dinner later that night! 

 ## **How to Use**
 ---------------
- The user can either start off by selecting a recipe from the different categories displayed on the left-hand side or search for a brewery through the modal that appears by pressing on the  "**FIND A BREWERY**" button. 
   **_It's up to the user to decide that!_** ðŸ˜‰

- The user will select a category for the types of recipes they would like to view. This will generate _nine_ different recipe cards with an image that the user can look through and select the one they would like to prepare.

- When the user clicks on a recipe card, the complete recipe will become viewable. The recipe will contain an image of the recipe, ingredient list and instructions.

- The user can search for a list of breweries in their city by clicking on the "**FIND A BREWERY**" button. When the button is clicked, a modal with an input field will appear instructing the user to enter the city they want to search.

- After the user enters the city and clicks submit, the modal will populate to give the names of three different breweries in their city.

- A user will be able to come back to the FIND A BREWERY modal and find the saved cities they have searched for. Making it easy to search for that city again.
